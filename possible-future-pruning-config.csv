Maybe it would be better to split configuration into two parts.

1. Backup units
   * Take the existing csv and ods example
   * Remove the pruning and retention portion
   + If borg adds new features in the future, it should be possible to
     simply add new columns.  The existing format will probably break
     without this...
   + Write a function that summarises everything that was backed up
     At a high level!  This is distinct from the verbose manifest.
2. Pruning units
   - Loss of backups will occur if the user misconfigures these
   * Disable pruning by default
   + Write a function that simulates a pruning and says
     something like "Targets for pruning: X, Y, Z"
                    "Proceed?"
   + Maybe this simulation functionality is already available upstream?
     If it's not, open an issue/feature request.
3. Write a script that generates both backup units and pruning units?
   * Don't bother doing this until 1.0 is near!
