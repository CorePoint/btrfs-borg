Warning, normal user Detected!
Please run with superuser permissions.

Allowing normal users to create subvolumes is a denial of service
attack vector, because if more than about 300 subvolumes are created
btrfs can crash, or halt with ENOSPC error; additionaly, performance
will suffer with more than ~300 subvolumes.

Finally root is required to remove subvolumes, unless
"user_subvol_rm_allowed" is specified for the volume in /etc/fstab.
That said, I firmly maintain that normal user subvolume creation and
deletion should be avoided for the foreseeable future.

Btrfs-borg will terminate now.
